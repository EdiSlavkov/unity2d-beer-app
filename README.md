BEER APPLICATION
The Beer Application is an Android app created with Unity2D that allows users to search for, add, and remove beers from their favorites list.

How It Works:
User Profile:

Users can create an account and log into their profile.
After successful login, users are redirected to the home page.
Home Page:

The home page displays a list of beers.
When the user reaches the bottom of the list and swipes again, more beers are loaded.
Clicking on a specific beer opens the full details page with a smooth animation.
Search and Filter:

Users can search for beers by typing the beer name or by using the filter button to access the filter page.
The filter page allows users to set various values such as alcohol by volume, bitterness, name, year, hops, and brewed before/after dates.
Favorites Page:

On the favorites page, users can view all beers that they have selected as favorites.
The favorites are displayed using carousel cards, providing a more detailed preview compared to the home page.
Users can still access the full details page from the favorites page.
Users can add or remove beers from their favorites list on the home page, full details page, or favorites page.
Options Page:

The options page provides additional features such as changing the password and logging out.
Note: The implementation of the dark/white theme toggle is not finished.
