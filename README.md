# BEER APPLICATION

The Beer Application is an Android app created on Unity2D for beer search, add, and remove from favorites.

## Highlights

- User profile creation and login
- List of beers with infinite scrolling
- Full details page for each beer with animation
- Search functionality by beer name
- Filter options for refining search results
- Favorites page with carousel cards
- Add/remove beers from favorites
- Options page for password change and logout
- Dark/white theme toggle (Work in progress)

## How It Works

1. User Profile: Users can create and log into their profile. After successful login, the user is redirected to the home page.

2. Home Page: The home page displays a list of beers. Infinite scrolling is implemented, loading more beers when the user reaches the bottom of the list. Clicking on a beer opens the full details page with a smooth animation.

3. Search and Filter: Users can search for beers by typing the beer name or using the filter button. The filter page allows users to set various criteria such as alcohol by volume, bitterness, name, year, hops, and brewed before/after dates.

4. Favorites Page: The favorites page shows all beers that the user has selected as favorites. Carousel cards provide a detailed preview of each beer. Users can add or remove beers from their favorites list from the home page, full details page, or favorites page.

5. Options Page: The options page offers additional functionality such as changing the password and logging out.

**Note:** This application was developed using Unity2D for Android and is a work in progress.
